Are you an experienced IT professional looking to take your career to the next level? You may want to consider getting certified by Azure to boost your design solutions credentials. Passing the Microsoft AZ-305 Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions exam validates you as an Azure Solutions Architect Expert, which could come in handy in your current role or the next time youâ€™re looking for a new job. In this course, instructor Elkhan Yusubov helps you to prepare to tackle the Design Infrastructure Solutions section of the AZ-305 exam. Discover the basics of Azure design solutions to meet the needs of any business-critical situation: designing a compute solution, an application architecture, migration and network solutions, and more. Along the way, test out your new skills for the certification exam in the practice challenges at the end of each section.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
